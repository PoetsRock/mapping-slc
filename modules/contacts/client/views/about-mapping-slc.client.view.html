          <h1>About Mapping Salt Lake City</h1>

          <p>Because a city and its history are not static but a complex network of connections,
            environment and relationships, the purpose of Mapping Salt Lake City is to create a
            continually evolving narrative in which community members and scholars, writers and
            artists can be in dialogue. And because there are always absences in any record of
            place, we rely on readers to fill in these gaps by writing and submitting their own
            content. Over the years, as more people add their own stories, Mapping Salt Lake
            City will change, expand and grow in the same ways that a city might, to become a more
            inclusive reflection of our community's diverse, and diverging, perspectives.</p>

          <p>Mapping Salt Lake City is an independent, not-for-profit community project based on <a
            href="http://rebeccasolnit.net/atlases/" target="_blank">Rebecca Solnit's book <em>Infinite City</em></a>,
            which maps many of the communities and histories
            that make up San Francisco. Initially the focus of a 2013 nonfiction writing course at
            the University of Utah taught by Paisley Rekdal, Mapping Salt Lake City has quickly
            become a city-wide collaboration led by professors, writers and scholars from the University
            of Utah and Westminster College.</p>

          <p>Interested participants can <a
            href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=279">contribute</a>
            in a number of ways: by writing a critical, historical or personal essay or by
            producing
            a multi-media project about a subject relevant to Salt Lake; by creating a personal
            city
            map using mapping technologies such as Google Maps or Google Earth; by drawing their
            own
            Salt Lake City <a
              href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=280">using
              the map found on our site</a>; or by writing for our ongoing project, "This Was
            Here."</p>

          <p>Our hope is for Mapping Salt Lake City to become an integral site for the community
            to
            visit, a place for people to enter the complex conversation about place that has
            already
            begun, and that continues to evolve, around Salt Lake City.</p>

          <p>We welcome you to join our community, either by assisting in the development of the
            site,
            or by submitting work to the project.</p>
